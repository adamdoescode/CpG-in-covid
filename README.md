### Introduction

This is a simple project for learning how to do some bioinformatics, use git and github better and get a better understanding of biopython and the practicality of doing something like this in python.

I conclude that I can probably find faster tools to do the same project in R or in Galaxy (although Galaxy is far less reproducible).

Click on `analysis.html` to see what I have done! `cpg_functions.py` provides a bunch of functions. All of these were used at some point in the development process (see /development_notebooks) but only a few are used in the final `analysis.ipynb` notebook.
